            </div>

            <p>First, let me introduce myself. My name is shtabdee paul. I want to be a web developer.After deciding I
                wanted to get into web development the first question on my mind was “What do I learn?”After doing some
                research, I ended up making my learning path based on what most entry-level web developer positions
                asked for, which is:JavaScript, HTML & CSS, CSS Preprocessors (Less & Sass),Responsive Design,AngularJS,
                Design Patterns Git,NodeJS etc.So,I joined a online course Programming-Hero to achireved what i want. I
                have already leared basic HTML and CSS.I think i can do complete that course with my determination and
                hard work, i can learn about programming and one day i will be a succesful web developer. </p>

            <p>Instead of doing the same thing every single day, it is beneficial to try new things. Learning is a
                relatively permanent change in behavior or knowledge that results from experience. Learning can be
                adaptive and flexible to meet life's demand. Although it is important to learn new things.So,in 2022 i

            <p>Everyone has something he or she is passionate about and loves to do every time without getting bored,
                for me it is programming.I started out with visual basic and then later on HTML, CSS and C++. I am
                currently starting out on an online arduino course and it has all been a very wonderful experience.
                Writing codes gives me a sense of satisfaction, it is one of the things I feel I can do well and enjoy
                at the same time.

                    night
                    to fulfill the food needs of all over the country. But the farmers are always on the dark side when

                    talk about the development of our country.
                    We will build apps that will help our farmers to maintain their farm precisely according to weather
