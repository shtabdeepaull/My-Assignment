            <p>First, let me introduce myself. My name is shtabdee paul. I want to be a web developer.After deciding I
                wanted to get into web development the first question on my mind was “What do I learn?”After doing some
                research, I ended up making my learning path based on what most entry-level web developer positions
                asked for, which is:JavaScript, HTML & CSS, CSS Preprocessors (Less & Sass),Responsive Design,AngularJS,
                Design Patterns Git,NodeJS etc.So,I joined a online course Programming-Hero to achireved what i want. I
                have already leared basic HTML and CSS.I think i can do complete that course with my determination and
                hard work, i can learn about programming and one day i will be a succesful web developer. </p>
